## About

The **Stock Price Prediction using LSTM** project is focused on leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast the future prices of stocks, specifically PT Aneka Tambang Tbk (ANTM). The primary goal is to create a model that can predict stock prices accurately based on historical data, helping investors and analysts make informed decisions. This project explores the intricate workings of LSTM, including how it overcomes the challenges associated with time-series data, such as the vanishing gradient problem.

Key aspects covered in this analysis include:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing data, normalization, and preparation of time-series data for modeling.
2. **LSTM Model Construction:** Building and training an LSTM model to capture patterns in stock price movements.
3. **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using metrics like MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.
4. **Future Price Prediction:** Applying the trained model to predict future stock prices and analyzing its accuracy.

This project is valuable for investors, data scientists, and anyone interested in applying deep learning techniques to financial data analysis.
